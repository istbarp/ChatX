\chapter{Conclusion}

ChatX have been a very design heavy system where a lot of thoughts went into how the system should be designed.

\section{Future Work}

There were a larger amount of features that did not get implemented due to the scale of the project, but it is possible to extend the system with these features in the future a minimal changes and additions to the current system.

A client solution that was suggested was a web client which would be accessible by a web browser and would also be the client which would require the largest changes as a web client can not yet fully use sockets in the way the system currently works. Instead there the web client could run in a loop requesting the webservice for new messages. Additional SSL would need to be implemented to make the solution secure and encrypted.

Voice over IP(VoIP) and video chat was an other technology that was considered to be implemented. A few changes could make this possible on the current clients, but for a web client either a plug-in and/or a cloud services would be necessary. 

A though was also at the client side to be able to embed, for instance medias, such as videos and images directly into the chat and make it possible for to view without opening external tools or programs.

Lastly an idea was to make a multi platform encryption system, but making such system fell, out of the scope of the course but could have simplified some of the work, as some systems does not comunicate well with each other.
