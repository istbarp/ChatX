\chapter{System Design}

\section{Business case}

ChatX is a chatting system which will allow users to communicate with each other from where ever they are and without fear of the messages being read by unwanted users, as long as they use a platform that supports the application and have a internet connection.

\subsection{What issue will ChatX solve?}
It will be possible to integrate the system with other systems where users could have need of communication with other users on a secure connection that will be hard for others to sniff data from. Thus making sure that messages are private and only seen by the intended users.

\section{Architecture}
ChatX's architecture will be a client-server architecture. The client will call the server whenever a user requests to use the system and the server will keep track of how many users are online and where each user messages is suppose to be sent to.
