\section{Introduction}

This report has been worked on as part of the system integration course, with the purpose of learning to develop an application that makes use of multiple technologies taught in the course. The application is known as ChatX, an instant messaging system that provides client-side RSA encryption for its users and will make it difficult for unwanted third party listeners to understand the messages. This report will describe how the process was planned, how the application was designed, the implementations of our solutions and lastly conclude on the project, alongside with thoughts and considerations of what could be improved on in the application and the process.
